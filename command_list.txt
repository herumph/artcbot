!moose
It started as a joke, when Tweeeked commented that the rabbit upvote button looked like a moose. In retaliation, CatzerzMcGee made the downvote button a moose. The moose as representative of ARTC caught on, and when logos were being brainstormed for our first singlet the moose rose to the top.
